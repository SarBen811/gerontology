Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Sara Benist, and I am a
Masters of Public Health student at the University of Georgia. This
website is my final project for Foundations of Aging (GRNT 7100E)
intending to provide information to the public about Age-related Macular
Degeneration. Please explore the website to learn more about the disease
and how it relates to you!

Main takeaways:

    developing the disease

-   Learn AMD is diagnosed and treated

-   Learn about how to prevent and slow progression of AMD
