Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Sara Benist, and I am a Masters of Public Health student at the University of Georgia. This website is my final project for Foundations of Aging (GRNT 7100E) intending to provide information to the public about Age-related Macular Degeneration. Please explore the website to learn more about the disease and how it relates to you!
