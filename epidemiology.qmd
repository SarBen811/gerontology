# Prevalence of AMD

Approximately 19.8 million people over the age of 40 in the US had AMD
in 2019. 8 out of 10 AMD cases have the dry form which slowly forms over
several years and may be without symptoms. AMD is more common as age
increases, and almost half of people over 85 have age-related macular
degeneration.

and Non-hispanic White populations are twice as likely to develop AMD.
